## Background

Graph algorithms are fundamental in computer science for solving problems related to network navigation and optimization. This project is designed to explore these algorithms in depth, particularly the A* Search algorithm, which is known for its efficiency in pathfinding and routing in various applications like GPS navigation and game programming.

## Implementation Details

Graph Implementation: A comprehensive implementation of graph data structures, including vertices, edges, and various graph traversal methods.

A Search Algorithm*: An efficient pathfinding algorithm that prioritizes nodes based on both the known shortest path and an estimated distance to the target.

Breadth-First Search (BFS): A standard graph traversal technique used for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Star System Teleportation Problem: A unique application that uses A* Search to find the shortest path across different star systems, considering teleportation points for instantaneous travel.

## Key Features
